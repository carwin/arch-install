This is an opinionated Arch Linux installation guide. It has evolved over more than ten years and probably still contains some legacy pieces here or there.

The most current guide in this repository is `EFI-btrfs-luks-homed`. The other guides will likely fall into major obscurity but are left for historical purposes.
